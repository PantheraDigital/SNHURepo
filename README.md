# CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle
An exploration of SDL by taking on the different roles in Scrum in order to learn about the Agile development environment, Scrum team roles/events/artifacts, and Agile practices to develop high quality software<br>

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are what people expect of your software and are problems they want solutions to. User stories are simply a way to refine those needs to the necessary details needed for developers to solve the problem. This allows problems users face to become features in the program that solve that problem. 

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Originally I would come up with an idea for a program I wanted to make, wrote down some bullet points on what features I wanted, then just dove in and tried to make it with what resources I had. I found this to be only so effective. After talking this class and learning some Agile techniques I have incorporated a sort of “daily Scrum” and “project backlog” to my approach which has improved my productivity with my projects. Now after I have a list of small features to implement each day, at the end of the day I assess my progress and plan the next day. My “project backlog” is a document with larger features and details about the overall program that gets updated as progress is made and new features come to mind I may want to add. My “daily Scrum” is the smaller list of tasks I use for daily progress tracking and planning. 

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	
A good team member is someone who communicates with their team. This applies to any team, including software development. This communication is important as it allows the team as a whole to work together and adapt to various situations. For example if a developer is unsure of something and they communicate the team can work together to help them find a solution that works for their situation, opposed to them keeping to themselves and finding a workaround solution that may not work in the future or the team environment.
