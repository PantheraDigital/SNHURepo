The Game Room client is a fictional client for the fictional tech consultant Creative Technology Solutions of which I work for and was tasked with assisting the Game Room. They wanted to port their existing game "Draw It or Lose It", an app for Android, to be a web based game.

Their software requirements:
- A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
- Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

In creating the documentation I believe I did well in finding their design constraints and giving a good explanation of the UML.
<br>
<br>
Through the process of working through a design document I found that planning out a system with UML and identifying the requirements helped me when developing my code as it allowed me to have a more clear picture of what the end result should be.

If I could choose one part of my work to revise I would choose the final section, "Recommendations", as I found that the most difficult due to the vagueness of what was wanted and my lack of deep understanding in some areas.

It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because software is ultimately for the user, even at lower levels so that a user can operate a system without having to manage things such as memory of connected devices. Software is made for humans to interact with computers in a clean and efficient way which is why thinking of the user is important. 
<br>
<br>
I approach designing software by first understanding the goal of the software, what it wants to accomplish or what it should be used for, then diving deeper into how it should be created, what possible architecture it may use, and how a user will interact with it.
